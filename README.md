# Thyroid Dosage Calculator Web Application

This web application was requested by a local endocrinologist, and should primarily be used by doctors.

This application should be used when it is determined that one dose across the course of a week is too little for a patient's needs and another is too high.

This program takes both doses and determines all of the possible ways that a dosage can be provided that is between the "too little" and "too high" doses (in terms of the weekly cumulative dose).

# Visual Demonstration

Let's say that a doctor determines that a dosage of 125 micrograms taken 7 times a week is too little for a patient, but a dosage of 137 micrograms taken 7 times per week is too high for the patient.

To determine the options in between those two dosages, the doctor should input the two dosages in the sections marked "Too Little" and "Too High," and a list of possible dosages will be provided, ordered by cumulative weekly dose.

# Additional Capability

This calculator also has the ability to recommend a daily dosage based on a patient's height or weight. The calculator will then determine what dosage should be provided based on typically orderable amount of medication.

Let's say that a doctor has a male patient with a height of 70 inches and a body weight of 155 pounds, and they want to use the patient's ideal body weight for the calculation. In addition, the patient had thyroid surgery, meaning they will likely need more medication.

They should input these details (while keeping the dropdowns the same), and the result of the calculation will be provided below.

While the exact amount of medication recommended is 146 micrograms per day, the closest amount that is typically orderable is 150 micrograms per day.

As such, both options are provided to the user.
